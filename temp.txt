A brief overview of the visualizations created in this example and the dashboards (tabs in top navigation bar) where they can be found:

* Scalars show how the loss and metrics change with every epoch. You can use them to also track training speed, learning rate, and other scalar values. Scalars can be found in the Time Series or Scalars dashboards.
* Graphs help you visualize your model. In this case, the Keras graph of layers is shown which can help you ensure it is built correctly. Graphs can be found in the Graphs dashboard.
* Histograms and Distributions show the distribution of a Tensor over time. This can be useful to visualize weights and biases and verify that they are changing in an expected way. Histograms can be found in the Time Series or Histograms dashboards. Distributions can be found in the Distributions dashboard.
  
Additional TensorBoard dashboards are automatically enabled when you log other types of data. For example, the Keras TensorBoard callback lets you log images and embeddings as well. You can see what other dashboards are available in TensorBoard by clicking on the "inactive" dropdown towards the top right.
